# Metal Gear Solid Peace Walker HD Textures
A Texture Pack for Metal Gear Solid Peace Walker, for use in the PPSSPP Emulator.
This Texture Pack was made for the US version of Peace Walker. There are no guarantees it may work on EU or JP.

To install, download as ZIP, then go to the TEXTURES Folder found in:
PPSSPPDir/memstick/PSP

If it doesn't exist, create it, along with a ULUS10509 folder, and then drag'n'drop all contents from the ZIP to ULUS10509.

In the end, it should look like this: **PPSSPPDir/memstick/PSP/TEXTURES/ULUS10509/AllOfThisGitContents**

It should automatically work if you have not disabled texture replacement.

Please delete the folder before updating or it may cause errors.
