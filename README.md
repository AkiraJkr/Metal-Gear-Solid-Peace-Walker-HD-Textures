# Metal Gear Solid Peace Walker HD Textures
A Texture Pack for Metal Gear Solid Peace Walker, for use in the PPSSPP Emulator.
This Texture Pack was made for the US version of Peace Walker. It is compatible with EU, but I can't confirm if the JP version works.

This is a project that ANYONE can contribute to, simply contact my Discord! AkiraJkr#6764

To install, download as a zip and drag'n'drop the zip at PPSSPP's main menu. It's that easy. Just make sure you launched the game ONCE.

~~To install, download as ZIP, then go to the TEXTURES Folder found in:
PPSSPPDir/memstick/PSP~~

~~If it doesn't exist, create it, along with a ULUS10509(ULES01372 if it's EU) folder, and then drag'n'drop all contents from the ZIP to ULUS10509.~~

~~In the end, it should look like this: PPSSPPDir/memstick/PSP/TEXTURES/ULUS10509/MasterFolderFiles~~

It should automatically work if you have not disabled texture replacement.

Please delete the folder before updating or it may cause errors.
